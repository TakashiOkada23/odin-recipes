    <h2 class="recipetitle">What is Cream Stew?</h2>
    <p class="recipes">
      Although it is considered western-style food (洋食 – yōshoku) in Japan,
      Cream Stew is a Japanese invention that was likely inspired by a few
      dishes from the West, including Irish Potato Soup, Banquette de Veau, and
      Poulet à la Normande. <br />
      The first printed reference to a stew made with milk appears in a 1924
      book by Kaneko Tezuka, and after WWII, a stew made with milk powder was
      introduced into school lunches to combat malnutrition.
      <br />
      Cream Stew went mainstream when House Foods introduced a powdered roux
      product in 1966 that made the dish’s preparation easy. These days it’s
      common to use bricks of Cream Stew roux similar to the blocks used to make
      Japanese-style curry. <br />
      I wanted to create a recipe from scratch that captures the silky smooth
      texture and rich umami of the blocks without significantly increasing the
      effort required to prepare it.

    <br />
    <h2 class="recipetitle">Steps</h2>
    <br />
    <ol class="recipes">
      <li>
        To make the roux, stir together the heavy cream, flour, and dried milk
        powder until it forms a smooth paste and set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the cream stew, heat a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and
        add the oil, onion, carrots, and potatoes. Saute the vegetables,
        constantly stirring for about 5 minutes, or until the onions start
        turning translucent but do not let them brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the vegetable stock, chicken, salt, pepper, and bay leaf, then turn
        the heat up to high to bring the liquid to a boil. Use a spoon or
        skimmer to remove any foam or oil that floats to the surface and
        continue doing so until there is no more foam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn down the heat to low, partially cover the pot with a lid, and let
        this simmer for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Par-boil the broccoli in a well-salted pot of boiling water for about a
        minute and then drain it and set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the timer on the stew is up, add the mushrooms, submerge them and
        cook them through. This should take about a minute or two.
      </li>
      <li>
        To temper the roux, add a few ladles of the hot liquid from the stew
        into your roux and use a whisk to dissolve the roux until there are no
        lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the mushrooms are cooked, pour the tempered roux into the stew,
        along with the creamed corn and stir this together. Bring the Cream Stew
        to a simmer to thicken the sauce, but do not let it boil.
      </li>
      <li>To finish the stew, add the broccoli and heat it up.</li>
    </ol>
